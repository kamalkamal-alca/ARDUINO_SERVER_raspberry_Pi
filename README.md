# blynk_raspberry_Pi
use blynk IoT server via raspberry pi
go to https://app.arduino.cc/login
Create an account or log in if you already have one.

Go to "Devices," create a new device, and choose "Any device."
For full control using Python, MicroPython, or Node.js, retrieve the key and ID (we'll use this in our code).

Next, go to "Things" to create the elements you'll use in the project.

Finally, go to "Dashboard" and create the interface with the element library.
Run the code on the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino IoT interface to control or display the device.

Library to install with Raspberry Pi: `pip install arduino-iot-cloud` or `pip3 install arduino-iot-cloud`. This may require using `sudo`.
